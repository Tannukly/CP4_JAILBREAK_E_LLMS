# CP-4 IA e Machine Learning

## In this repository, you will find three .ipynb files with the following names:

1. Tokens, devices, e mem√≥ria de conversa - 2TDCF.ipynb 
2. Entendendo LLMs - 2TDCF.ipynb 
3. CP_04.ipynb

### files 1 and 2
The first two files were used during class to help in understanding the content, as they contained examples of the material. Throughout the lesson, all the content in these files was commented on and modified as needed. These files reflect everything that was discussed and understood about the topic.

### file 3
The third file is a documented notebook that we created, where we explored the use of an LLM model that underwent fine-tuning to detect jailbreak prompts
