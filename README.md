2. Entendendo LLMs - 2TDCF.ipynb 
3. CP_04.ipynb

### files 1 and 2
The first two files were used during class to help in understanding the content, as they contained examples of the material. Throughout the lesson, all the content in these files was commented on and modified as needed. These files reflect everything that was discussed and understood about the topic.
