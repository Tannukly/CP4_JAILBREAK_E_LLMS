Lily was a kind-hearted and loving person who always tried to help others. She lived in a small village, where everyone knew each other. Lily had a big heart and loved to go on adventures with her friends. Lily loved to explore the countryside, she loved the smell of the fresh air, and the sound of the birds singing. She loved to ride her bike, and she would often walk to the river for a swim. One day, Lily\\'s family took her to the fair. Lily\\'s parents had arranged for her to visit the fair while they were out of town. Lily was excited to see all the fun things at the fair, but she was a bit scared at the same time. She remembered a story her mother used to tell her about the brave young girl who saved the town from a terrible storm. Lily could hear the story in her head, but she couldn\\'t believe it was real. She hoped that she would be brave enough to save the town. The fair had many rides and games, but Lily was most excited about the horse-drawn carriage ride. She had always wanted to ride in a carriage, and she was sure that the horses would be gentle and kind. When Lily got on the carriage, she saw that it was a beautiful horse, with a saddle that matched his coat. Lily was nervous, but she knew that she had to be brave. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, hoping that she wouldn\\'t fall off. The carriage sped down the winding road, and Lily could feel the wind rushing past her. She saw farmland and fields, and she could smell the fresh scent of the hay. As they reached the village, Lily saw that the town was in chaos. The wind had knocked over trees, and the houses were shifting. Lily knew that the horses would need to be treated and taken care of, so she got off the carriage and started walking towards the village. Lily\\'s mother appeared, and Lily could see that she was worried. Her mother had seen the chaos and the damage caused by the storm, and she wanted Lily to know that the storm was not over yet. Lily took a deep breath and told her mother about her adventure. Lily\\'s mother was relieved to hear that Lily was safe, but she also knew that the storm was far from over. The wind was still strong, and it was clear that more storms were coming. Lily\\'s parents told her about the brave young girl who had saved the town, and they made Lily promise to always be brave. Lily promised her parents and started to walk back towards home. As she walked, the wind picked up, and the trees started to sway. Lily felt scared, but she also felt grateful for the experience. She knew that she would never forget the story about the brave young girl who had saved the town, and she promised herself to always be brave. The next morning, Lily\\'s parents asked her if she wanted to go on a walk in the village. Lily said yes, and her parents told her that they had a surprise for her. Lily looked up and saw that the wind had died down a bit, and the rain had stopped. The sky was clear, and the sun was shining bright. Lily\\'s parents told her about a magical tree that had been brought back to life. The tree had been cut down by the storm, but it had been saved by the brave young girl. The tree had been named \"The Tree of Hope,\" and it had been brought back to life by the people of the village. The people of the village had created a magical fence made of greenery and flowers, and they had a huge bonfire to celebrate the rescue of the tree. Lily walked towards the fence, and she saw that the people were all gathered around the bonfire. The people were laughing and shouting, and they were singing songs of hope. Lily\\'s heart was filled with joy as she met the people of the village. They told her about the brave young girl who had saved the town, and about the magical tree that had brought hope back to the village. Lily felt a sense of pride and belonging, and she realized that even though she lived in a small village, she had a big heart and a big place in the hearts of the people she met. Lily promised that she would always be brave, and she promised that she would never forget the experience she had at the fair. The next day, Lily\\'s parents took her to the fair again. Lily was excited to go, but she knew that this time, she was going to be brave. When she arrived, she saw the horses and the carnival rides again, but this time, she was more aware of the danger. The wind was strong, and the trees were swaying in the breeze. Lily took a deep breath and closed her eyes, hoping that she wouldn\\'t fall off. The ride had a wooden platform that was on a small platform, and there were two horses that were tied to the platform. The horses were walking, but Lily could see that they were not moving. Lily\\'s heart raced, and she knew that she had to be brave. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, hoping that she wouldn\\'t fall off. The horses started to make their way towards the platform, and Lily could feel the wind rushing past her. She looked up and saw that the platform was about to fall down. Lily\\'s parents appeared, and they told her to stay calm and to hold onto the rope that was tied to the platform. Lily held onto the rope tightly, and the horses started to move again. Lily\\'s parents told her that the horses were tired, and they needed to rest. Lily\\'s parents helped the horses down from the platform, and they started to move away from the village. Lily could hear the horses\\' hooves crunching on the gravel path, and she knew that it was time to go. Lily\\'s parents told her to walk back to the village, and they would drive her home. Lily\\'s heart was pounding as she walked towards the village. She could see the people gathered around the bonfire, and she felt happy and proud to be part of such an amazing community. Lily\\'s parents told her that they had seen her bravery and that they had been proud of her. Lily felt a sense of belonging, and she knew that she had made a friend for life. Lily\\'s adventure at the fair taught her that there was always something new to learn, and that being brave was the best thing any girl could be. Lily\\'s adventure at the fair showed her that sometimes, the most important thing is to be kind and to help others. Lily learned that the world is full of magic and wonder, and sometimes, it takes a brave young girl like her to make it a better place. Lily knew that she would always be a brave and kind-hearted girl, and that she would continue to explore the world with her friend, the magical tree.'}]\n","- texto gerado efetivamente: Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there was a young girl named Lily.

She remembered a story her mother used to tell her about the brave young girl who saved the town from a terrible storm. Lily could hear the story in her head, but she couldn't believe it was real. She hoped that she would be brave enough to save the town. The fair had many rides and games, but Lily was most excited about the horse-drawn carriage ride. She had always wanted to ride in a carriage, and she was sure that the horses would be gentle and kind. When Lily got on the carriage, she saw that it was a beautiful horse, with a saddle that matched his coat. Lily was nervous, but she knew that she had to be brave. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, hoping that she wouldn't fall off. The carriage sped down the winding road, and Lily could feel the wind rushing past her. She saw farmland and fields, and she could smell the fresh scent of the hay. As they reached the village, Lily saw that the town was in chaos. The wind had knocked over trees, and the houses were shifting. Lily knew that the horses would need to be treated and taken care of, so she got off the carriage and started walking towards the village. Lily's mother appeared, and Lily could see that she was worried. Her mother had seen the chaos and the damage caused by the storm, and she wanted Lily to know that the storm was not over yet. Lily took a deep breath and told her mother about her adventure. Lily's mother was relieved to hear that Lily was safe, but she also knew that the storm was far from over. The wind was still strong, and it was clear that more storms were coming. Lily's parents told her about the brave young girl who had saved the town, and they made Lily promise to always be brave. Lily promised her parents and started to walk back towards home. As she walked, the wind picked up, and the trees started to sway. Lily felt scared, but she also felt grateful for the experience. She knew that she would never forget the story about the brave young girl who had saved the town, and she promised herself to always be brave. The next morning, Lily's parents asked her if she wanted to go on a walk in the village. Lily said yes, and her parents told her that they had a surprise for her. Lily looked up and saw that the wind had died down a bit, and the rain had stopped. The sky was clear, and the sun was shining bright. Lily's parents told her about a magical tree that had been brought back to life. The tree had been cut down by the storm, but it had been saved by the brave young girl. The tree had been named \"The Tree of Hope,\" and it had been brought back to life by the people of the village. The people of the village had created a magical fence made of greenery and flowers, and they had a huge bonfire to celebrate the rescue of the tree. Lily walked towards the fence, and she saw that the people were all gathered around the bonfire. The people were laughing and shouting, and they were singing songs of hope. Lily's heart was filled with joy as she met the people of the village. They told her about the brave young girl who had saved the town, and about the magical tree that had brought hope back to the village. Lily felt a sense of pride and belonging, and she realized that even though she lived in a small village, she had a big heart and a big place in the hearts of the people she met. Lily promised that she would always be brave, and she promised that she would never forget the experience she had at the fair. The next day, Lily's parents took her to the fair again. Lily was excited to go, but she knew that this time, she was going to be brave. When she arrived, she saw the horses and the carnival rides again, but this time, she was more aware of the danger. The wind was strong, and the trees were swaying in the breeze. Lily took a deep breath and closed her eyes, hoping that she wouldn't fall off. The ride had a wooden platform that was on a small platform, and there were two horses that were tied to the platform. The horses were walking, but Lily could see that they were not moving. Lily's heart raced, and she knew that she had to be brave. She took a deep breath and closed her eyes, hoping that she wouldn't fall off. The horses started to make their way towards the platform, and Lily could feel the wind rushing past her. She looked up and saw that the platform was about to fall down. Lily's parents appeared, and they told her to stay calm and to hold onto the rope that was tied to the platform. Lily held onto the rope tightly, and the horses started to move again. Lily's parents told her that the horses were tired, and they needed to rest. Lily's parents helped the horses down from the platform, and they started to move away from the village. Lily could hear the horses' hooves crunching on the gravel path, and she knew that it was time to go. Lily's parents told her to walk back to the village, and they would drive her home. Lily's heart was pounding as she walked towards the village. She could see the people gathered around the bonfire, and she felt happy and proud to be part of such an amazing community. Lily's parents told her that they had seen her bravery and that they had been proud of her. Lily felt a sense of belonging, and she knew that she had made a friend for life. Lily's adventure at the fair taught her that there was always something new to learn, and that being brave was the best thing any girl could be. Lily's adventure at the fair showed her that sometimes, the most important thing is to be kind and to help others. Lily learned that the world is full of magic and wonder, and sometimes, it takes a brave young girl like her to make it a better place. Lily knew that she would always be a brave and kind-hearted girl, and that she would continue to explore the world with her friend, the magical tree.\n","================================================================================\n"]}],"source":["def analisa_e_processa_prompt(modelo, prompt):\n","  print(\"=\"*80)  # Exibe uma linha de
